# $how Me The Money

Meetings are expensive, but sometimes we forget how expensive they are and feel the need to talk for too long about topics that are unimportant for the meeting purpose.

This is an app to display the costs of meetings, and track the costs of your meetings over time.

The idea of the App is to be able to display the real-time cost of a meeting as it occurs.
This cost is calculated based on the hourly wages of the meeting's attendees and the current duration of the meeting.

The intended effect of this App is to make meeting attendees aware of how much this time is costing the business.
